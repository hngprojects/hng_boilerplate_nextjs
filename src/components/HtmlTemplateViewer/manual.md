FILES:
index.tsx - This file holds the view that consist of the MAIN component and some other dummy component e.g (breadcrumbs, texts, an edit content button etc...), it also simulates the functionality of the component i.e (to edit template and to preview template).
TemplateViewer.tsx - the is the main standalone component (MY TASK, based on the issue created [#43](https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_nextjs/issues/43))
template-example.tsx - this contains dummy html templates (please NOTE: converting react.js template to html before parsing into the preview component is not specified in the task brief..but it can be done.)
HtmlTemplateViewer.test.tsx - this is the test file
manual.md - a mini read me file to help reviewers navigate the component.

HOW TO USE:
Just import the HtmlTemplateViewer folder(index.tsx) into the admin page (/admin) to view the component.
